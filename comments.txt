Need to make it angle agnostic, because candidate can move their laptops in between and they can also move their head around.
Also it was a bit heavy to play around, we need to make it a light weight but this can be done when we achieve the objective, we can work on this after that.
Accuracy was also not good, might be because i move the laptop, but that's an actual scenerio.
